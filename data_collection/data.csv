90,2023-04-19 11:56:14+00:00,@Paul13_Walnut5 @Paul1Singh She is a strange one. Regarding nuclear. Radioactive waste not to be dumped in England but it's ok for it to be dumped in Scotland. This is the type of thing that pisses us off big time. https://t.co/dSeC8zqo5o

His work on Iodine 131 paved the way for modern nuclear medicine &amp; he received @NobelPrize in 1951. @officialEANM https://t.co/ncWp2XFRs6"
93,2023-04-19 11:26:13+00:00,@ShaunBurnie @mark_lynas Fossil fuel is used from uranium mining down every step across the uranium development chain (UDP) to DGR and nuclear fuel reprocessing. The emission of NPP's are radioactive by-products of processed uranium ore. Environmental health don't stand a chance.
94,2023-04-19 11:16:07+00:00,"@stonecut2010 @ivenms @MyloLuxuria @seattle_elite @Not_the_Bee No the Nuclear waste will break down over time. It only takes a long time.
2nd, the waste is actually miniscule. It takes like a 100 nuclear plants to produce the same amount of waste as a coal one.
Meanwhile coal powerplants produce radioactive waste that can NOT be broken down."
95,2023-04-19 09:58:30+00:00,"And finally, for the avoidance of doubt, it’s a myth to say #nuclearpower is renewable. #Nuclear power uses radioactive fuel, a limited source of energy. Check out our new infographic in full here 📊🔗: https://t.co/eltLvxtnZl [END] https://t.co/Y4fVgswwMt"
96,2023-04-19 09:41:30+00:00,~93% of the replacement energy will be from coal and gas. Coal produces ~100x more radioactive waste than nuclear. They have made Germany more radioactive. But they don't care. They are fanatically anti-nuclear and you can't argue with fanatics.
97,2023-04-19 08:56:31+00:00,"@BenPHeard @jordanbpeterson @TerrestrialMSR Fossil fuels release solar energy previously captured by photosynthesis. It's delayed sunshine.

Nuclear power generates of 50% waste heat that did not come from the sun.

Fission power has the additional cost in the burden on next generations to care for radioactive waste."

Have fun as your cities will be turned to radioactive dust soon.  @strobetalbott
