"@MarvolianJoe @TheGreenParty @carla_denyer The definition of green hydrogen is flawed, green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis using renewable energy only (renewable energy is not carbon neutral). So hydrogen produced using nuclear is not green hydrogen. You do realise blue MUST use carbon capture to offset production."
@dorfman_p @historyscoper Most of the comments in the article are so wrong that I have to wonder if this is satire. Baseload is a very well understood concept among utilities. The article also provides no facts and is risible. Nuclear is really the best way to reduce carbon emissions.
